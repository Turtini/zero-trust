# Zero Trust Architecture Reference Library

This repository is a living reference for designing, operating, and sustaining **Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA)** in regulated federal environments.

It focuses on **how Zero Trust actually works in practice** once software is deployed — including architecture, automation, ownership, and Day-2 operations — rather than abstract frameworks or product descriptions.

The materials here are written for senior architects, platform engineers, security leaders, and program owners responsible for long-term outcomes.

## Why This Repository Exists

Many Zero Trust efforts stall not because of missing tools, but because of:
- unclear ownership
- fragmented authority
- manual enforcement
- contractor-dependent operations
- undocumented institutional knowledge

This repository exists to capture **operational patterns that survive audits, personnel changes, and budget cycles**.

It is intentionally practical, opinionated, and grounded in real federal constraints.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A **reference library**, not a campaign
- A **working vocabulary** for architecture and governance discussions
- A **bridge** between policy intent and operational reality
- A **tool for internal alignment**, documentation, and continuity

The content here is meant to be:
- read
- discussed
- adapted
- cited internally

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a product catalog  
- Not a compliance checklist  
- Not a theoretical whitepaper  
- Not vendor marketing  

This material is focused on **operating systems and organizations at scale**.

## Contents

### Architecture & Framework Mapping
- **CISA Zero Trust Pillar Mappings**  
  Practical mappings between the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model and real platform capabilities.

### Operating Models
- **Day-2 Operating Model**  
  How Zero Trust is sustained after deployment through automation, validation, and ownership.
- **Ownership Models**  
  Clear ownership patterns that reduce risk, lower contractor dependency, and improve audit outcomes.
- **Organizational Alignment**  
  How authority, incentives, and responsibility must align for Zero Trust to succeed.

### Implementation Guidance
- **Implementation Considerations**  
  Real-world constraints, tradeoffs, and lessons learned.
- **Common Anti-Patterns**  
  Repeated failure modes observed across Zero Trust initiatives.

### Visual References
- **ZTMM Mapping Diagram**  
  Visual representation of Zero Trust pillars and operational responsibilities.

## How to Use This Library

This repository is commonly used to:
- Frame architecture reviews
- Support Zero Trust planning discussions
- Document current-state and target-state operations
- Reduce reliance on oral history and contractor knowledge
- Prepare for audits without creating parallel documentation

Content is modular and intended to be reused internally.

---

## Stewardship and Philosophy

Zero Trust is not a project.  
It is an **operating posture**.

Sustainable Zero Trust requires:
- automation as enforcement
- identity as the control plane
- platforms as shared infrastructure
- ownership that survives personnel changes

This repository reflects that philosophy.
